# rofretta-go ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/cptavatar/rofretta-go.svg?branch=master "build status")
---

Rofretta is primarily an exercise for myself in reimplementing a solution in a domain I find interesting in 
 different ways. This time around, I decided to try my hand at Go - be nice! 

I develop rofretta in two stages. During the first I build out basic building block with the first goal 
to be able to slurp in a file of chord voicing definitions which exercises most of the basic functionality. 
 The second phase I build out a basic chord detection algorithm so one can pass in shorthand like "032010" and
 it can be properly identified as "C Major"
 
 Maybe this is useful to you, maybe not.
